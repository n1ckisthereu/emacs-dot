This is my first try using emacs, the ideia is make the emacs look my neovim
configuration, the ideia is use this emacs for manage my life, programming,
studie and write.

* Nimacs - tracker

** IMPORTANT
The next sections i'nst important, i didn't like using emacs to edit code,
but i like so much the emacs workflow, to work with buffers, I really liked
git using magit, but I decided to keep it just for taking academic notes
with org, and I kept many of the settings I had made so as not to lose
any progress.

The progress list bellow is not use more, but i decided mantein if i'm
back to emacs for coding
